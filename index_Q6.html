    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical
      elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe
      for iron. H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into
      groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

    <p>
      Chemical reactions are represented using <dfn>chemical equations</dfn>.
      Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i> <br />
      <br />
      2H <sub>2</sub> + 0<sub>2</sub> 2H <sub>2</sub>0

      <br /><br />This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas
      (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas to fonn water (H<sub>2</sub>0).
    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
      Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chenucal
      reactions. It Involves balancmg chemical equations to ensure mass and
      charge are conserved. <br /><br />

      <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a
      molecule. while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of
      atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
      Chenustry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our
      bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
